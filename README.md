Cardiovascular Heart Failure Features Analysis Machine Learning Accuracy Model

For this Cardiovascular heart failures analysis, the purpose and effort is to investigate how to use EDA analytics and a basic Random Forest Classifier ensemble model for determining model performance accuracy and precision that might be later developed into are more robust AI ML model apply to the Cardiovascular diseases dataset analysis.  
    
For Cardiovascular heart failures, it is well know that Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally. Effecting an estimated 17.9 million lives each year; or approximatly 31% of deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains several data features that may be used in Exploratory Data Analysis and later in machine learning with the ability to predict survivability of heart failure by Cardiovascular diseases.

This Cardiovascular heart failures analysis and EDA models to visualize how patients survival for risk of heart failure is ranked. This data study evaluates levels and measures related to serum creatinine and ejection fraction, and alsl other risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, aneamia, smoking.
